# University Research Projects

A collection of computational modeling and data analysis projects demonstrating skills in simulation, statistical analysis, and complex systems research.

## Projects

### 1. [Predator-Prey Ecosystem Simulation](./project-1)
**Course**: Modeling and Analysis of Complex Systems | **Date**: Fall 2025  
**Skills**: Python, Agent-Based Modeling, Spatial Analysis, FFT Analysis

Implemented a reaction-diffusion model simulating fox-bunny population dynamics on a 200×200 spatial grid. Identified critical phase transition thresholds where systems shift from stable to oscillatory behavior. Discovered that diffusion rate ratios create distinct spatial patterns (scattered, clustered, uniform). Compared empirical simulation results with mean-field theoretical predictions, revealing how spatial structure enables coexistence at higher densities than theory predicts.

### 2. [Traffic Congestion Prediction](./project-2)
**Course**: Modeling and Analysis of Complex Systems | **Date**: Fall 2025  
**Skills**: Python, NetworkX, OSMnx, Graph Theory, Network Analysis

Enhanced an agent-based traffic simulation using Berlin's real road network from OpenStreetMap. Developed a density-based congestion model incorporating the Nagel-Schreckenberg framework. Derived a predictive "traffic pressure" metric (betweenness centrality / capacity) that follows a power law relationship with congestion (R² = 0.80). Successfully generalized model to Buenos Aires without recalibration (R² = 0.92), demonstrating that network topology alone can predict congestion hotspots.
